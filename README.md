# Software-Development-for-I-O-circuit-analysis-for-MMIC-and-power-amplfiers-using-Smith-Chart
A Smith Chart based software is being developed to define input/output matching topologies for designing amplifiers applications. Topology may be L-type, T-type or Ï€ - type. The tool is also meant for ABCD parameters analysis to obtain total ABCD parameters of a given topology. This will enable the user to obtain Input/Output impedance levels of that topology which helps the user matching the circuit. Besides, a tool will also help to obtain optimised path on Smith Chart of less sensitivity with respect to frequency. Such a path will form Input/Output matching network of an amplifier. Thus the user may get the required matching network directly from this tool. These I/O matching networks shall be used in designing MMIC (Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit) circuits and applications. The current ADS and AWR softwares used by DRDO-SSPL do not have the functionality of a auto-path finder on Smith Chart for optimised circuits. Our software will solve this issue and will be used by the Scientists of DRDO to speed up their research and fabrication processes. This is being done as an innovative development work in SSPL for the first time.
